505	853146	PHB2	Phb2p	Saccharomyces cerevisiae		YGR231C				Two classes of prohibitin dependent mutation (pbd1 and pbd2) were isolated and characterised. The effect of these mutations on replicative lifespan was determined, demonstrating that the pbd1 mutant slightly extended lifespan by 11%, whereas in contrast, the pbd2 mutation resulted in a shortening in both the mean- and the maximum-lifespan by (28 and 17%, respectively). The pbd1 mutation was also found to reduce chronological lifespan. Reducing the expression of the PHB2 gene in the pbd mutants was found to retard the rate of growth and to affect replicative lifespan. As the two mutants behave in a different manner they probably affect different aspects of prohibitin function.

621	853568	SOD1	Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase	Saccharomyces cerevisiae		YJR104C		CRS4	increase	Increasing the level of active Cu, Zn-Sod in yeast was found to require either growth in the presence of high copper, or the simultaneous overexpression of both SOD1 and CCS1 (the latter being the gene that encodes the chaperone dedicated to Cu(2+)-loading of Sod1p in vivo). Dual SOD1 + CCS1 overexpression elevated the levels of Cu,Zn-Sod activity six- to eight-fold in vegetative cultures. It also increased the optimized survival of stationary cells up to two-fold, showing this chronological lifespan is ultimately limited by oxidative stress. In contrast, several detrimental effects resulted when the SOD1 gene was overexpressed in the absence of either high copper or a simultaneous overexpression of CCS1. Both the chronological and the replicative lifespans were shortened; the cells displayed an abnormally high level of endogenous oxidative stress, resulting in a high rate of spontaneous mutation. Such harmful effects were all reversed through the overexpression of CCS1.	pro			Overexpression	2532: Harris et al.
