The aim of this research is to improve our understanding of the conserved mechanisms of aging in order to find ways to reverse its adverse consequences and delay or even prevent the onset of age degenerated diseases.  We use time series data from yeast and maybe later also from other species to look for conserved changes in gene expression and protein expression patterns over time.  

A list of time series datasets for yeast can be found at http://microbialcell.com/table-1-hallmarks-of-human-aging-aging-in-yeast/ [1].  Pathway and Gene Ontology analyses are used to identify pathways, molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components that change in response to aging in a similar way.  Emphasis is placed on understanding how the decoupling between transcription and translation drives the aging process [2].  Changes in the transnational machinery, particularly affecting ribosomes and their assembly are considered.   

Lifespan data from 674 knockout mutants [3], for which transcription and translation was measured at 12 different time points in the yeast's life [2], is used to find correlations between changes in the gene expression pattern associated with aging. 

Knocking out genes for which the uncoupling between mRNA and protein abundance rises over time tend to extend lifespan.
